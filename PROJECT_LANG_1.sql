-- About:
-- I decided to make SQL the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-SQL) as SQL is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the SQL programming language. It only makes sense to SQL the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
